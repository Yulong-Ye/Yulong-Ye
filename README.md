# Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD student at the **University of Birmingham**, working at the intersection of **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)** and **Software Engineering for AI (SE4AI)**.

## 🧐 Research Interests
- 🧠 **Self-adaptive Systems**
- 🔁 **Multi-fidelity Configuration Tuning**
- 🏔️ **Fitness Landscape Analysis**
- 🧬 **Evolutionary Computation**
- 🤖 **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**

## 🚀 Current Work
I’m exploring how intelligent algorithms can efficiently tune complex systems like databases, compilers, and servers using limited computational budgets — powered by **multi-fidelity search**, **evolutionary algorithms**, and **landscape insights**.

## 📂 Selected Topics I’m Working On
- Multi-fidelity Configuration Tuning
- EA/BO for configuration tuning
- Dynamic optimization under workload drift

## 📫 Let’s Connect
- 📖 Academic Homepage: https://yulong-ye.github.io/
- 📧 Email: yeyulong666@gmail.com

## 🎯 Fun Facts
- I'm deeply curious about optimization and system behavior.
- I enjoy building frameworks that generalize across AI/SE domains.
- I enjoy watching 🎬, listening to 🎵, and exploring 🥘 when I'm not debugging tuning loops!
